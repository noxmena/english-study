                            <p class="mb-2">In 1969, newspaper headlines told us that walking on the moon was possible. Since then, scientists have continued their research to create high-tech machines to advance space exploration. Because of this, news reporters are
                                now telling us that we may all have the chance to visit the moon one day.</p>
                            <p class="mb-2">Only twenty-four humans have ever visited the moon, but by 2024 a Japanese businessman called Yusaku Maezawa will have become number twenty-five. The only problem is that the rocket he will travel in has not been built yet.</p>
                            <p class="mb-2">Yusaku will be travelling in a high-tech rocket, known as the Big Falcon Rocket, which will have seven engines and will be able to carry one hundred passengers. Once it has been built, the 118-meter-high rocket will eventually
                                carry passengers around the Moon, allowing space travel for anyone who can pay the price of the flight.</p>
                            <p>The cost of the flight might be a problem to anyone who isn't Yusaku, who is thought to be paying over £52 million for his flight!</p>
